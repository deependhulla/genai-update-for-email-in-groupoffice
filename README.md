# GroupOffice GenAI Email Enhancement (Groq API Integration)  

This repository provides an update to **GroupOffice Community** by integrating **Groq API** to enable GenAI-powered features:  

- **Email Summarization** – Quickly extract key points from emails.  
- **AI-Assisted Email Writing** – Generate email drafts with AI.  

## Features  

- **Summarize any email** with a single click.  
- **Generate email responses** using AI suggestions.  
- **Seamless integration** within the GroupOffice email module.  

## Installation  

### 1. Prerequisites  
- A working **GroupOffice Community** installation.  
- **PHP 8+** and required dependencies.  
- An active **Groq API key** ([Get it here](https://groq.com/).  

### 2. Setup & Patching  

Refer to **[setup-notes.txt](setup-notes.txt)** for a step-by-step guide on:  
- Patching GroupOffice to integrate this addon.  
- Adding the required API configurations.  
- Ensuring compatibility with existing modules.
- I have created a setup-notes.txt file containing code instead of using .patch files for various files. The reason is that GroupOffice updates frequently, and maintaining patch files for each version can be challenging and may lead to issues. This notes file will help developers or IT personnel search for and add the necessary code more easily.
